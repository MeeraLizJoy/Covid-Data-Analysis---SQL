# COVID-19 Global Data Analysis Using SQL and Tableau

## Project Overview

This project analyzes global COVID-19 case, death, and vaccination data to provide insights at country and continent levels. Data cleaning, aggregation, and advanced SQL queries are used to compute key pandemic metrics, which are then visualized in an interactive Tableau dashboard.

---

## Data Sources

- COVID-19 case, death, and vaccination data sourced from the **World Health Organization (WHO) official datasets**  
- Data imported and managed in a SQL Server database with multiple related tables for comprehensive analysis

---

## Tools and Technologies

- **SQL Server:** for data extraction, cleaning, aggregation, and computation of pandemic metrics  
- **Tableau:** for creating interactive dashboards, charts, and maps visualizing trends and comparisons  
- **SQL Queries:** demonstrate use of joins, window functions, CTEs, temp tables, views, and aggregation

## Key Analyses and Visualizations

- Computation of death percentages (deaths per confirmed cases) by country and continent  
- Infection rate relative to country population  
- Rolling sum of vaccinations to track immunization progress  
- Comparative analysis of death counts and vaccination coverage between continents and countries  
- Interactive dashboard highlighting geographic and temporal trends of COVID-19 worldwide

## Project Structure

- `SQL_Queries.sql` — contains all SQL scripts for data extraction and transformation  
- Tableau workbook and dashboard — interactive visualizations accessible [here](https://public.tableau.com/shared/FCR8C3C76?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)  
- Documentation notes and project summary in this README

## How to Use

1. Load the COVID-19 datasets into your SQL Server environment  
2. Execute the SQL scripts in order to clean and aggregate data  
3. Connect Tableau to the SQL Server database or exported tables  
4. Explore the dashboards for detailed insights and trends

## Challenges and Learnings

- Handling missing and inconsistent data entries effectively using SQL  
- Synchronizing multiple datasets (cases, deaths, vaccinations) on common keys like country and date  
- Designing Tableau dashboards that enable dynamic and comparative analysis of pandemic progression
